## CVE Reference
CVE-2023-3181

## Common Weakness Enumeration
CWE-379: Creation of Temporary File in Directory with Insecure Permissions

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Base Score: 7.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details

The C:\Program Files (x86)\Splashtop\Splashtop Software Updater\uninst.exe process creates a folder at C:\Windows\Temp\~nsu.tmp and copies itself to it as Au_.exe. The C:\Windows\Temp\~nsu.tmp\Au_.exe file is automatically launched as SYSTEM when the system reboots or when a standard user runs an MSI repair using Splashtop Streamerâ€™s Windows Installer. Since the C:\Windows\Temp\~nsu.tmp folder inherits permissions from C:\Windows\Temp and Au_.exe is susceptible to DLL hijacking, standard users can write a malicious DLL to it and elevate their privileges. 
## Resolution
The issue was fixed in version 1.5.6.23
