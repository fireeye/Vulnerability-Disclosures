# MNDT-2024-0009

## Description
Lakeside Software’s SysTrack LsiAgent Installer contains a local privilege escalation vulnerability which affected version 10.7.8.

## Impact
High: Exploiting the vulnerability will give an attacker SYSTEM level privilege.

## Exploitability
High: Any authenticated local user can exploit the vulnerability and an exploit is trivial to produce.

## CVE ID
CVE-2023-6080

## Common Weakness Enumeration
https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/379.html

## Common Vulnerability Scoring System
Base Score: 8.8 - Vector: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

## Technical Details
Upon running SysTrack’s MSI repair operation, MSIExec.exe copies an executable file into the standard user’s %TEMP% folder using formula-based name generation. MSIExec.exe then executes the file as SYSTEM after a short delay. Due to the file permissions of the folder, a standard user can overwrite the file before MSIExec.exe executes it, which could lead to elevation of privilege.

## Resolution
The issue was fixed in version 11.0.
