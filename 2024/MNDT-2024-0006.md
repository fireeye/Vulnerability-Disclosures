# MNDT-2024-0006

## Description
Mandiant identified a Boolean-based SQL injection vulnerability in the RHUB TurboMeeting web application versions 8.0.4 and earlier. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server, potentially allowing them to access sensitive data or compromise the server. Exploitation of this vulnerability, along with the “Insecure Password Reset Mechanism” and “Command Injection in Certificate Signing Request” vulnerabilities, allowed Mandiant to authenticate to the web application as the “admin” user and obtain remote command execution as “root”.

## Impact
Very High: The access to sensitive information, modification or deletion of data, disruption of database operations, access to the underlying operating system, and reputational damage are common detrimental effects of SQL injection on the security and integrity of the database and the data it contains.

## Exploitability
Low: There are multiple SQL injection filters enforced by the application, making exploitation difficult. As such, this vulnerability is not discoverable by a typical automated scanner and would require a motivated adversary to exploit it.
