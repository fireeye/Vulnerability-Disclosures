# MNDT-2024-0004

## Description
Mandiant observed that the password reset functionality of the RHUB TurboMeeting application versions 8.0.4 and earlier resets passwords to a random 8-digit value instead of allowing users to set a new password of their choice.

## Impact
High: This vulnerability severely compromises the security of user accounts, especially the default “admin” user. Moreover, the lack of user control over password selection weakens the overall security posture of the system, as legitimate users may be less motivated to choose strong, unique passwords, and could decide to keep the 8-digit password.

## Exploitability
High: An attacker simply needs to initiate a password reset through the application’s home page.

## CVE Reference
CVE-2024-38287

## Technical Details
http://HOST/as/wapi/forget_password can be used to force a password reset against any user with no email address associated to its account, such as the default “admin” user.

## Resolution
Vendor is unresponsive and possibly defunct. There is, at the time of disclosure (see Disclosure Timeline), no fix for this vulnerability.
