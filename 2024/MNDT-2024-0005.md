# MNDT-2024-0005

## Description
The Certificate Signing Request (CSR) feature in the admin portal of the RHUB TurboMeeting application versions 8.0.4 and earlier are vulnerable to command injection. This vulnerability could allow authenticated admin users to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying server by injecting malicious input into the CSR generation process. The application failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a command executed with root privileges

## Impact
Very High: The impact of this vulnerability is severe, as it could grant attackers with admin-level access the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server with root privileges. This could lead to complete compromise of the server, including unauthorized access to sensitive data, disruption of services, and potential further exploitation of the system.

## Exploitability
Low: This vulnerability requires authentication as an admin user, which limits the attack surface to authenticated users with elevated privileges.
